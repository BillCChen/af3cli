# af3cli Examples

This directory contains example files demonstrating the usage of `af3cli` through both CLI inputs and as a Python library.

## Example Directories

The examples are organized into two main directories:

1. `/cli/` - Contains examples for using `af3cli` via the command-line interface.
2. `/python/` - Contains examples for using `af3cli` as a Python library.

Both directories contain examples covering the same six situations:

### Examples

1. **Bonds**
   - Demonstrates assigning a covalent bond to a specified residue of a protein sequence using a Ligand in CCD representation.

2. **DNA**
   - Contains an example of a simple double-stranded DNA (dsDNA).

3. **Modifications and PTMs**
   - Demonstrates handling modifications of DNA and RNA, as well as protein post-translational modifications (PTMs).

4. **Protein Systems with Ligands**
   - Initiates a system containing a protein and a Ligand without pre-specified interactions:
     - Example with Ligand in **SMILES** format.
     - Example with Ligand in **CCD** format.

5. **RNA Fasta Reader**
   - Demonstrates how to use the implemented FASTA reader to read an RNA FASTA file.

Each example is structured to showcase specific functionalities and workflows supported by `af3cli`. These examples should help users understand both the CLI usage and Python integration for different use cases.

Feel free to explore the `/cli/` and `/python/` directories for detailed example files.
