# af3cli Examples

This directory contains example files demonstrating the usage of `af3cli` through both CLI inputs and as a Python library.

## Example Directories and Purpose
The examples are organized into three main directories:
1. `/cli/` - Demonstrates how to use `af3cli` via the command-line interface.
2. `/python/` - Covers examples for using `af3cli` as a Python library in various workflows.
3. `/jupyter/` - Provides interactive examples using Jupyter notebooks.

These directories contain examples illustrating the same core scenarios for consistency.
